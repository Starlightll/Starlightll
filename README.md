# Hey there, I'm Starlight! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a student with big dreams, a passion for coding, and a knack for injecting humor into my daily study routine. When I'm not buried in textbooks or debugging my own projects, I'm exploring exciting technologies and cracking a few programming jokes. ðŸ˜‰

## About Me

- **Name:** Starlightll
- **Status:** Student | Lifelong Learner | Future Tech Guru (shit gonna be true) "some day :)"
- **Major:**  Computer Science, Software Engineering
- **Interests:** Learning computer science, games development, and finding the humor in every bug.

## Education

I'm currently studying at **[FPT University]**, where I dive deep into the theories and practicalities of modern computing. Every day is a new opportunity to learn something awesome (and occasionally learn why my code doesn't work)!

---

## Programming Journey

I started with simple scripts and gradually worked my way up to building projects that help me understand and appreciate the art of coding. Some milestones along the way:

- **Beginners' Phase:** Fumbling with "Hello World" and celebrating every successful run.
- **Intermediate Phase:** Tackling projects with frameworks and libraries; debugging feels like a sport.
- **Advanced Phase (In the Making):** Creating innovative projects while laughing at my own coding jokes!

## Skills & Technologies

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Java, C, C# (and a secret mastery over "CoffeeScript" â€“ just kidding, it's all about coffee! â˜•)
- **Tools:** Git, VS, VSCode, Intellij Idea, Unity, SQLServer, Docker, and other handy study companions.
- **Frameworks:** Familiar with the basics of React, Springboot, ASP.NET Core, Node.js, or any useful library that eases my learning curve.

## Projects & Coursework

Here are some projects that I've built as part of my coursework and personal experiments:

- **[Study Buddy](https://github.com/Starlightll/study-buddy):** A project designed to help students manage their study schedules and track progress. (Also doubles as a procrastination tool!)
- **[Code Quizzer](https://github.com/Starlightll/code-quizzer):** A fun quiz app that tests your programming knowledge with a dash of humor.
- **[Debugging Diaries](https://github.com/Starlightll/debugging-diaries):** A repository chronicling my debugging adventuresâ€”with plenty of anecdotes and learning moments.
