# Hi there, I'm Starlightll 👋

## About Me
I'm a passionate developer with a love for Game Development, Web Development, and all things programming. When I'm not coding, you can find me battling bugs (both in code and in real life) or dreaming up my next big project! 🚀

## What I Do
- **Game Development** 🎮: Bringing virtual worlds to life with Unity. If you see me talking to my computer, don't worry, I'm just debugging... or plotting world domination.
- **Web Development** 🌐: Crafting beautiful and functional websites. No, I can't fix your WiFi (or can I), but I can make your website look awesome! :D
- **Sh*ty Programming** 💻: My code might not always work, but at least it looks...gek.

## Languages and Tools I Use
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, C# (I speak fluent binary too, beep boop)
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** React, Angular, Node.js, Springboot, ASP.NET, (Because who doesn't love a good library?)
- **Game Development:** Unity (Where my digital dreams come to life)
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, VS Code, Intellij Idea, Jupyter Notebook (My trusty sidekicks in the coding adventure)

<!--## My Projects
Here are a few of my favorite creations:
- **Project 1:** [Epic Quest](link) - An RPG game where you save the world from evil forces. Spoiler: The real treasure was the friends we made along the way.
- **Project 2:** [Web Wizard](link) - A magical web app that makes your life easier. Abracadabra! Your to-do list just got sorted.
- **Project 3:** [Data Dynamo](link) - A powerful data analysis tool for all your needs. Because data doesn't analyze itself... yet.--->
